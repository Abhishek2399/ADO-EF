Tropical Storm Fred is expected to form Tuesday, prompting tropical storm watches and warnings across the northern Caribbean.

If it forms, Fred will be the sixth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season and will make its way to the southern US this weekend. The disturbance is currently a potential tropical cyclone and the National Hurricane Center is forecasting it to strengthen into a tropical storm Tuesday afternoon or evening.
"Satellite imagery shows that the disturbance has become better organized since yesterday," the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday morning.
The system is moving west-northwestward at 18 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph. As it continues to progress through the Caribbean, the potential cyclone will bring the threat of flooding, mudslides, and dangerous winds to the islands in the region.
